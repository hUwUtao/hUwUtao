> [!NOTE]
> I recently had to move out due to a natural incident caused by a sinkhole in a nearby water pump. Luckily, most of the device is fine and relocated to a stable living area. Also RIP jr.Chiffon the kitty and my manga/figurine collection T-T (chiff is still alive but barely finding food inside collapse building).
